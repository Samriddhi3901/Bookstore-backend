📌 Technology Stack
Node.js: Handles server-side logic and API management.
Express.js: Provides a lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: Stores book data efficiently in a NoSQL format.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions.
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file to secure sensitive data.
Cors: Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow communication between frontend and backend.
Nodemon: Restarts the server automatically during development when files are changed.
